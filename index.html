<h1>*GAME ABOUT CLIMBING*</h1>
<p>The idea is to enhance the game I made few years ago.</p>
  <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>There will be 2 characters with abilities (strength, technique and rope management). They are going to have an inventory. 
  In that invenotry there would (or would not) be [pitons & hammer], [camalots], [wedges], [carabiners].
